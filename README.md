# Virtual Tourist
Udacity Nanodegree Project

Tour the world without leaving the comforts of your couch! 
In this project, youâ€™ll build an app that lets you tour the world from the comfort of your own couch. 
Users will be able to drop pins on a map, download pictures for the location, and save favorites to their device.
